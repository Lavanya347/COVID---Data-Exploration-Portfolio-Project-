# COVID-19 Data Exploration – SQL Portfolio Project

Overview:
This portfolio project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL, combining case, death, and vaccination datasets with demographic indicators. The project demonstrates data cleaning, aggregation, and advanced analysis using joins, window functions, and calculated metrics to generate actionable insights.

Key Highlights:

Joined COVID deaths and vaccination datasets to track trends per country and date.

Calculated rolling totals and percentage of population vaccinated using window functions.

Created reusable SQL views like PercentPopulationVaccinated for reporting and visualization.

Explored correlations between demographics (population, median age, GDP, health metrics) and COVID trends.

Skills Demonstrated:
SQL (T-SQL), joins, window functions, aggregations, view creation, and data exploration on real-world datasets.

Applications:
Can be used for dashboards, reporting, or further predictive modeling in Power BI, Tableau, or Python.
